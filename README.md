# Image Processing API Project

## Overview
This project creates an image processing API that takes images and resizes based on the query.

## Instructions
To use the Journal, first run the `npm run start` command on NodeJS and then open up the link `localhost:3000` on your browser where you should see a `Hello World!` as a confimation of the health of the API and the project should work as specified. Be sure that you enter the `/api/images` in order to access the functionality of the 
API.

## Dependencies
As mentioned, NodeJS is required to create the server. The npm packages used in production: `sharp` and `express` were included in the project.
